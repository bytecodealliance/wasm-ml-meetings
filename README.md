WebAssembly Machine Learning Working Group
==========================================

This repository keeps track of meetings held to discuss WebAssembly and machine learning, primarily
in the context of the [wasi-nn] specification. To receive a meeting invite, contact [Andrew Brown]
or [Mingqiu Sun] on Zulip via the `wasi-nn` Zulip [stream]; this stream is a helpful forum for
asking questions about this group.
