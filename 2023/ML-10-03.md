The virtual meeting was organized by Andrew Brown and included participants from various companies
such as VMware, Microsoft, Intel, and ByteDance. The main focus of the meeting was to discuss the
interests and implementation of machine learning and WebAssembly. Andrew Brown outlined the goals
of the group, emphasizing the need for community participation in the wasi-nn specification
implementation. The group discussed challenges they might face and the importance of testing and
making robust implementations. Andrew Brown highlighted the need to keep specification
implementations moving forward together and avoid leaving anyone behind.

In terms of the group's structure, Andrew Brown proposed forming a subgroup within W3C or creating
an informal workgroup under the WASI specification. The participants seemed open to this idea. The
overall aim of the meeting was to foster collaboration and community involvement in advancing the
wasi-nn specification implementation in the next six months.

During the discussion, Andrew Brown suggested creating a working group along the lines of
wasi-crypto and proposed having video meetings every three weeks. He also suggested creating a new
GitHub repository for the group's work. Ralph Squillace expressed support for the idea of a working
group and mentioned that it is not a necessity to be a member of the Bytecode Alliance. The group
discussed the structure and goals of the working group, with several members sharing their thoughts.

The meeting concluded with Andrew Brown noting that new issues may arise along the way. He also brought up various points related to the support and implementation of large language models (LLMs) in the context of the wasi-nn project. The conversation touched on the need for suggestions and feedback, as well as the inclusion of different types of tensors in the project.

Overall, the participants agreed on the importance of discussing and addressing various topics related to the support of LLMs in the wasi-nn project. The conversation also acknowledged the complexity and significant work involved in achieving these goals.

The meeting covered a range of topics, including web compatibility efforts, API design, and the
challenges of using WASI for large language models. The participants expressed interest in exploring
new use cases and potential major changes to the Wasi framework. They also mentioned an upcoming
event called Cloud Native Wasm Day in Chicago, which they encouraged attendance. The meeting
concluded with thanks to the participants and a reminder to continue the conversation in three
weeks.
